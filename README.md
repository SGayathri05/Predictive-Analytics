# Predictive-Analytics
This repository contains Python programs demonstrating predictive analytics using various statistical models. The examples include implementations of Linear Regression, Multiple Regression, and ARIMA models.
I have attached the dataset used for executing the program. 

## Linear Regression

Linear regression is a simple yet powerful statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The Python script `Linear_Regression.ipynb` demonstrates how to perform linear regression using the scikit-learn library.

## Multiple Regression
Multiple regression extends linear regression by considering multiple independent variables. The Python script `Multiple_Regression.ipynb` showcases an example of multiple regression using scikit-learn.

## ARIMA Model
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) is a time series forecasting model. The Python script `Arima_Model.ipynb` illustrates how to implement an ARIMA model using the statsmodels library.
